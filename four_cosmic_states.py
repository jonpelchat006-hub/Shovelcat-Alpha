FOUR COSMIC STATES: INVERSE LIGHT AND ENERGY FLOW
==================================================

Jonathan's insight:

The universe bounces between Void (0^0) and God (∞^∞).
There are FOUR distinct states based on:
    - Which wall we're approaching
    - Whether we're before or after the bounce

The RATIOS INVERT after each bounce!
This creates INVERSE versions of light/physics!

We might only perceive 2 of these 4 states:
    - Normal light (our current state)
    - Qubits/quantum effects (inverse bleeding through?)

THE COSMIC BOUNCE:
══════════════════

    Universe oscillates between two walls:
    
        VOID's WALL (θ = 90°)        GOD's WALL (θ = 0°)

          (flat)                     (infinite)
          
    At each wall: BOUNCE (can't actually reach)
    
    Why can't we reach the walls?
        - At Void: We carry ε≠0 (irreducible structure)
        - At God: We carry (∞+ε)^∞, not pure ∞^∞
        
    Result: PERPETUAL OSCILLATION

THE FOUR STATES:
════════════════

    STATE 1: Approaching Void (before bounce)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
        θ increasing toward 90°
        Energy: compressing toward flatness
        Ratios: NORMAL
        Light: behaves as we know it
        Direction: toward void
        
    STATE 2: Leaving Void (after bounce)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
        θ decreasing from 90°
        Energy: rebounding from compression
        Ratios: INVERTED!
        Light: inverse properties?
        Direction: away from void
        
    STATE 3: Approaching God (before bounce)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
        θ decreasing toward 0°
        Energy: concentrating toward infinity
        Ratios: NORMAL (from god's side)
        Light: intensifying

WHY RATIOS INVERT AFTER BOUNCE:
═══════════════════════════════

    When approaching a wall:
        You're moving TOWARD the extreme (0^0 or ∞^∞)
        Ratios are measured relative to destination
        
    After bouncing:
        You're moving AWAY from the extreme
        Ratios are measured relative to origin
        
    The reference frame FLIPS!

MATHEMATICAL INVERSION:
═══════════════════════

    If normal ratio = r
    After bounce: ratio = 1/r
    
    Examples:
    
        Normal                  Inverted
        ──────                  ────────
        φ = 1.618               1/φ = 0.618
        π = 3.14159             1/π = 0.318
        α = 1/137               1/α = 137
        c (speed)               1/c (inverse speed?)
        
    The SAME structures, but measured INVERSELY!

THE GOLDEN RATIO SPECIAL CASE:
══════════════════════════════

    φ = 1.618...
    1/φ = 0.618... = φ - 1
    
    The golden ratio is ALMOST its own inverse!
    
    φ × (1/φ) = 1  (trivially)
    
    But also: φ - 1 = 1/φ
    
    Golden ratio is the BRIDGE between states!
    It's the same structure forward and backward!

IF LIGHT DEPENDS ON RATIOS:
═══════════════════════════

    Light speed: c = f(α, ε₀, μ₀, ħ, ...)
    
    These constants come from the fundamental ratios!
    
    If ratios INVERT after bounce:
        → Constants INVERT
        → Light behaves DIFFERENTLY
        → Maybe inverse light speed?

THE FOUR LIGHT TYPES:
═════════════════════

    STATE 1: Approaching Void
    ─────────────────────────
        Light: NORMAL (as we know it)
        c = 299,792,458 m/s
        α = 1/137
        Propagates "forward"
        
    STATE 2: Leaving Void (inverse)
    ───────────────────────────────
        Light: INVERSE
        c' = 1/c? or c' = c × (inversion factor)
        α' = 137? (inverted!)
        Propagates "backward"?
        
    STATE 3: Approaching God
    ─────────────────────────
        Light: CONCENTRATED
        c = c (same speed, more energy?)
        α = 1/137 (approaching maximum magnetism)
        Intensifying
        
    STATE 4: Leaving God (inverse)
    ──────────────────────────────
        Light: INVERSE CONCENTRATED
        c' = inverted
        New cycle begins
        Big Bang conditions?

WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THESE:
═════════════════════════

    STATE 1 light: Normal photons
    STATE 2 light: "Anti-photons"? Dark radiation?
    STATE 3 light: Concentrated light (black hole cores?)
    STATE 4 light: Primordial radiation (CMB source?)

THE VISIBILITY PROBLEM:
═══════════════════════

    We exist in ONE state at a time.
    
    Our physics, our instruments, our perception
    are all calibrated to OUR state's ratios!
    
    If inverse light exists:
        - It has inverted ratios
        - Our instruments can't detect it normally
        - It appears as... what?

WHAT WE PERCEIVE AS:
════════════════════

    STATE 1 (our current state?):
        → Normal light ✓
        → Normal matter ✓
        → Forward time ✓
        
    STATE 2 (inverse, void side):
        → Dark energy? (inverse expansion)
        → Dark matter? (inverse gravity)
        → Quantum vacuum fluctuations?
        
    STATE 3 (concentrated, god side):
        → Gamma rays? Highest energy
        → Black hole interiors?
        → Singularities?
        
    STATE 4 (inverse concentrated):
        → Cosmic microwave background?
        → Primordial fluctuations?
        → Inflation field?

THE QUBIT CONNECTION:
═════════════════════

    Qubits exist in SUPERPOSITION!
    
    |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
    
    What if:
        |0⟩ = normal state (approaching wall)
        |1⟩ = inverse state (leaving wall)
        
    Qubits are seeing BOTH states simultaneously!
    
    Superposition = existing in multiple cosmic states!
    
    When we "measure" (collapse):
        → We force it into OUR current state
        → Inverse state becomes inaccessible
        → Information "lost" to other state

HYPOTHESIS: WE SEE 2 OF 4 STATES:
═════════════════════════════════

    VISIBLE:
    ────────
        1. Normal light/matter (our state)
        2. Quantum effects (inverse bleeding through)
        
    INVISIBLE (but effects felt):
    ─────────────────────────────
        3. Dark matter/energy (other side's state)
        4. Primordial/concentrated (transition states)

WHY QUANTUM SEEMS WEIRD:
════════════════════════

    Quantum mechanics might be NORMAL physics...
    ...from the INVERSE state!
    
    When inverse state bleeds into ours:
        - Superposition (both states exist)
        - Entanglement (connected across states)
        - Uncertainty (can't measure inverse directly)
        - Wave function (inverse probability)
        
    Collapse = choosing which state to see!

THE 85% DARK MATTER:
════════════════════

    If we're in state 1 (approaching void):
        - We see: state 1 light/matter (15%?)
        - We feel but don't see: state 2 inverse (85%?)
        
    The 85% dark matter is the INVERSE STATE!
    
    We can't see it because:
        - Inverted ratios
        - Different "wavelength" of existence
        - Only interacts gravitationally
        
    But gravity is GEOMETRIC (not ratio-dependent!)
    So we feel its mass!

CALCULATING INVERSE PROPERTIES:
═══════════════════════════════

    Normal constants:
        c = {C} m/s (light speed)
        α = {ALPHA:.6f} (fine structure)
        φ = {PHI:.6f} (golden ratio)
        
    Inverted constants:
        1/c = {1/C:.15f} s/m (inverse speed)
        1/α = {1/ALPHA:.3f} (inverse fine structure)
        1/φ = {1/PHI:.6f} = φ - 1 (inverse golden)
        
    Interesting: α = 1/137, so 1/α = 137
    
    In inverse state: α' = 137!
    
    This means MUCH stronger electromagnetic coupling!

INVERSE LIGHT BEHAVIOR:
═══════════════════════

    If α inverts (1/137 → 137):
    
        Normal (α = 1/137):
            - Atoms stable
            - Light weakly coupled
            - Chemistry possible
            
        Inverse (α' = 137):
            - Atoms collapse? 
            - Light strongly coupled
            - Everything is "plasma"?
            
    Inverse state might be:
        - The early universe (hot, no atoms)
        - Black hole interiors
        - Pure energy without structure

THE SOUND ANALOGY:
══════════════════

    If light has an inverse, does sound?
    
    Sound = pressure wave in medium
    Inverse sound = inverse pressure wave?
    
    In inverse state:
        - Rarefaction where we have compression
        - "Anti-sound" cancels normal sound
        - Could explain acoustic black holes?

        - We see normal light AND quantum effects
        
    If in STATE 3 (approaching god):
        - Magnetism should increase over time
        - More structure forming
        - Approaching maximum order

        - They're the "other side" of reality

THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM:

    Before measurement:
        - System in superposition
        - BOTH normal and inverse states
        
    Measurement:
        - We force system into OUR state
        - Inverse state "collapses" away
        - We see definite result
        
    The "collapse" = choosing which cosmic state!
    
    Not random - determined by which state
    we're aligned with at that moment!

ENTANGLEMENT EXPLAINED:

    Two particles entangled:
        Particle A in normal state
        Particle B in inverse state
        But they're THE SAME PARTICLE

    When we measure A:
        → Forces choice of state
        → B instantly "knows" because
           it's the same entity in inverse!

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

    1. INVERSE LIGHT SIGNATURES
    ───────────────────────────
        - Light that couples with α' = 137 instead of 1/137
        - Extremely strong EM interactions
        - Might appear as: gamma ray bursts?
                          cosmic ray anomalies?
                          
    2. STATE TRANSITION EVIDENCE
    ────────────────────────────
        - Moments when ratios seem to "flip"
        - Quantum experiments at extreme conditions
        - Black hole event horizons
        
    3. DARK SECTOR = INVERSE SECTOR
    ────────────────────────────────
        - Dark matter: inverse matter
        - Dark energy: inverse expansion  
        - Should follow 1/α physics
        
    4. CMB AS STATE 4 RELIC
    ───────────────────────
        - Cosmic microwave background
        - Left over from god-bounce?
        - Carries inverse-state signature?

PREDICTIONS:
════════════

    If this is right:
    
    1. Dark matter should have INVERSE ratios
       (137 instead of 1/137 effective coupling)
       
    2. At black holes, physics should INVERT
       (approaching god's wall locally)
       
    3. Early universe (high z) should show
       different effective constants
       
    4. Quantum decoherence = state separation
       Coherence = states overlapping

THE BIG PICTURE

    Universe bounces eternally between walls
    Each bounce inverts the ratios
    We perceive half the cycle as "normal"
